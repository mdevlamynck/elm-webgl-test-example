= Elm WebGL tests example

Example of a setup for testing webgl rendering.
The approach uses snapshot testing meaning that when a test is run for the first time it's result will be considered as the expected result and stored as a snapshot.
On subsequent test run, the result is compared to the stored snapshot and if it matches the test passes.
When the result and the snapshot differ, a diff image is generated to help debug.

Uses:

* `node-elm-compiler` to build test cases to html
* `puppeteer` to run the generated code through a headless browser and take a screenshot of rendered webgl
* `jest-image-snapshot` to test the screenshot against a reference and generate a diff image on failure

Run webgl tests with `yarn tests:webgl`.
